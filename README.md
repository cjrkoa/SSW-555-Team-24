# Welcome to ShareEvent!
Share event is a brand new way for communities to share new events made to foster connections and improve outreach

To learn more about initiating the repository environment, read the documentation shared below:
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started


First, install dependencies using an installed package manager:

```bash
npm install OR npm i
# or
yarn install OR yarn
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```


Next, run the development server using the chosen package manager:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```


Finally, to start the server on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), open up a new terminal and paste the following commands:

```bash
cd backend
#
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
